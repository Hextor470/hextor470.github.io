## What is This? (Some Kind of Intro)


 Hello! This is my first ever web-app. Recently, I've decided to become a front-end developer (afrer  years of very serious work in nuclear energy company as departmend lead). Since my competition in the information consumption begins...

 Also I love to play and learn music. Once I've run into some difficulties with this. I use a lot of different tools, but for my issue there was no one. Then I realize to try to apply my fresh knowledge of JavaScript, jQuery and Bootstrap.

 It was very tought days, many cups of coffee, stackoverflow searching, moments of hope and despair. After a couple of weeks the work was completed and I became a one of the happiest person in the World (actually not for a long time).

 I had no plans to publish my application anywhere, but right now it's the only thing that I can show in portfolio. Here we go!

## Technologies 
* HTML/CSS;
* JavaScript;
* Bootstrap;

## Structure of Code
1. Initial Static Information Block.
 * Data stored in arrays and objects;
 * If reengineering ever were to happen, it should be transfered to database.

2. Auxiliary Functions Block.
 * Some primitive functions which used everywhere;
 * arraysEquality, toCamelCase, etc.

3. Main Functions Block.
 * There are six long-description functions on ~600 lines.

4. DOM Manipulating Block.
 * Most of the content and SVG-element generating here.

## –êdditionally
* Due to the fact that it was a project for my own usage:
 * Quality of code is too low;
 * DIY design and UX;
 * There was no browser 
compatibility. If you want to try, use Chrome;
 * There was no perfomance optimization;
* Development took about 4 weeks;
* The code was developed in the structural / functional paradigm, due to lack of sufficient knowledge of the OOP at the time;
* The application is actively used in solving problems of music analysis and improvisation;
* Received great pleasure from the process of developement and outcomes.
